#bookwormquiz

I built this app using React

The app uses React concepts like props, components, events, the ReactDOM that renders
React to the browser, etc.,

bookwormquiz is an interactive game in which players are shown a random picture of 
an author and a randomly selected list of four books that contains at least one
book written by the author shown.

If a player clicks on the right answer the background turns green color and a continue
button appears at the bottom and the player may click the continue button to continue
to play the game.

Conversely, if a player selects a wrong answer the background turns red color and the
continue button does not appear. The player is expected to make the right choice upon
which the background changes to green color and the continue button appears at the 
bottom and the player may click the continue button to conntinue to play the game.
